# 6.104 Assignment 4: Implementing Concepts

Hello! For background context, I pivoted my idea from the dorm room layout collaboration (because of the issues with drag & drop functionality being so front-end heavy), and moved onto the idea of a sort of "social-media" for people to show off their dorm rooms. At MIT, I assumed all MCC doubles/Vassar singles/Maseeh quads/etc. are the same. This is to set up a world where a person, Alex, wants to see inspiration photos of other MCC doubles so she can copy the inspiration for her own room. Users can create posts, upvote, comment, filter, and more! WOO!

Shoutout to the amazing and wonderful Ane Zuniga for helping me realize I bit off a lot more than I can chew and helping me rescope the project. Special thanks to Brianna for helping me clean up my concepts!

Enjoy!
