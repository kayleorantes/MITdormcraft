# Overall Design Notes: DormGram

This document outlines the final design of the "DormGram" application, the rationale behind pivoting from the original idea, and a summary of key moments during the backend development process.

### ## Pivot from DormCraft to DormGram

The project's initial concept was "DormCraft," a collaborative tool for students to plan dorm room layouts before moving in. While this was a strong idea, I pivoted to "DormGram," an "Instagram for dorms," for several key reasons aligned with the course's principles:

1.  **Clearer Modularity**: The "Instagram" model lends itself perfectly to concept-oriented design. The ideas of a `User`, a `Post`, a `Room Template` (like a category), and `Engagement` (likes/comments) are distinct and self-contained. This made it much easier to design concepts with no direct dependencies, which was a core requirement.
2.  **More Focused User Value**: Instead of solving the logistical problem of layout planning, DormGram focuses on inspiration and community. It allows students to creatively share their personalized spaces and helps incoming students see the real potential of their future rooms, addressing the anxiety of the "unknown" in a different, more engaging way.
3.  **Simpler State Management**: The state for DormGram's concepts is more straightforward than DormCraft's, which would have required complex state to manage furniture positions, room dimensions, and real-time collaborative sessions. This allowed me to focus on mastering the essentials of the backend implementation and testing workflow.

### ## Final Application Architecture

The application is built on four independent, modular concepts that work together to create the full user experience:

* **`UserAccount`**: The foundation of identity. It knows nothing about posts or comments; it only manages user profiles.
* **`RoomTemplate`**: Acts as a controlled "tagging" system. It provides a catalog of all MIT room types (e.g., "Baker House Single") but knows nothing about the posts that use these tags.
* **`DesignPost`**: The core content concept. It links a `User` and a `RoomTemplate` to a piece of content (an image and description) but is completely unaware of social interactions.
* **`Engagement`**: The social layer. This concept is responsible for all comments and upvotes related to a `DesignPost`, but it doesn't store any of the post's actual content.

This separation ensures that the system is robust and extensible. For example, we could add a new type of engagement (like "bookmarks") by only modifying the `Engagement` concept, with no changes needed to any other part of the application.

### ## ðŸ’¡ Interesting Moments in Development

Here are 5 key moments from the implementation process. Each represents a significant learning step or a problem-solving discovery.

> **How to Get Your Links:** For each moment below, find the corresponding log file in your `/context` folder (it will be named with the date and time you ran the command). Open it on GitHub and copy the URL. This gives you a permanent link to the exact state of your code and prompts at that moment.

1.  **Learning Deno's Permission Model Incrementally**
    * **Link**: `[Link to the context file where you first saw the --allow-env error]`
    * **Explanation**: When I first ran my tests, I was hit with a cascade of permission errors: first for `--allow-net`, then `--allow-env`, and finally `--allow-sys`. This was a perfect practical demonstration of Deno's "secure by default" philosophy and taught me to think explicitly about what resources my code needs to access.

2.  **Solving the `unknown` Type Error with a Type Guard**
    * **Link**: `[Link to the context file showing the 'e is of type unknown' error and the fix]`
    * **Explanation**: I encountered an error where I couldn't access `e.message` in a `try...catch` block. I learned that this is a TypeScript safety feature and the solution is to use a type guard (`if (e instanceof Error)`). This was a key lesson in writing robust, type-safe error-handling code.

3.  **The Missing `await` and Understanding Promises**
    * **Link**: `[Link to the context file showing the 'require-await' linter error]`
    * **Explanation**: The linter flagged my `getPost` function for being `async` but not using `await`. This forced me to realize I was returning the `Promise` itself, not the resolved value. Adding the `await` keyword solidified my understanding of how asynchronous database calls work.

4.  **Fixing a Subtle Optional Chaining Bug**
    * **Link**: `[Link to the context file for the failed Engagement test]`
    * **Explanation**: My `Engagement` tests were failing with a `TypeError` because I was trying to call `.some()` on an `upvotes` array that didn't exist yet for posts that only had comments. The fix was changing `engagement?.upvotes.some(...)` to `engagement?.upvotes?.some(...)`. This was a fantastic lesson in the importance of optional chaining (`?.`) for writing resilient code that handles missing data gracefully.

5.  **Setting Up a Professional Project with `deno.json`**
    * **Link**: `[Link to the context file showing the 'no-import-prefix' error]`
    * **Explanation**: The linter initially wouldn't let me use full URLs for my test library import. This pushed me to create a `deno.json` file. I learned how this file centralizes dependency management, making the project cleaner and much easier to maintain than having URLs scattered across different files.
